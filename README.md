Amp allows you to easily mute your default communication recording device in Windows by setting binding a key.

It also allows you to cycle through your playback devices with a separate key binding.

* Sound notifications (optional)
* Tray icon shows current microphone status by color
* Quick access to volume mixer and sound options with said tray icon

How to use
======

The software is currently in alpha state, so there are no installations.

If you want to test and use it, download the [latest release](https://github.com/p3lim/Amp/releases) and run the executable.

Right-click the tray icon to access settings where you'll be able to bind your key(s)


Disclaimer
======

This software has only been tested on Windows 7 and later, I can not guarantee it will work on any earlier systems.

Please report [any bugs](https://github.com/p3lim/Amp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) you might find, and feel free to suggest [a feature](https://github.com/p3lim/Amp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).


Contributing
======

This is the first software I've ever developed on the Windows platform (and using C#), so I have no idea if the code is up to par with any convention.

Feel free to contribute by [forking](https://github.com/p3lim/Amp/fork) and sending me [pull requests](https://github.com/p3lim/Amp/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr).
